            <h3>Getting There and Away</h3>
            <p>Niagara-on-the-Lake is located about 30 minutes NW of Niagara Falls, near the border between the US and Canada.</p>
            <p>
                For those coming from Canada, it is a 1.5 hour drive South from Toronto's Pearson International Airport
                and a 1 hour drive East from Hamilton's John C. Munro International Airport.
            </p>
			<p>
                Those coming from the US might find it cheaper to drive to Buffalo or fly to Buffalo Niagara International Airport.
                The domestic flights to Buffalo are typically more cost-effective than flying internationally to Toronto.
                However, be sure to bring your passports and factor in additional travel time for the border crossing.
                There is a <a href="http://www.buffaloairportshuttle.com/">Buffalo Airport Shuttle</a> which offers transfers from the airport to Niagara-on-the-Lake.
            </p>
            <p>For those of you driving, we will try to facilitate carpooling with other guests.</p>
            <p>Bus service is also available to Niagara-on-the-Lake, though is not frequent and does require connecting through Niagara Falls. </p>
            <hr class="primary">
            <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
            <p>
                Below is a brief list of recommendations on places to stay in Niagara-on-the-Lake.
                It is Canada Day weekend - a big deal! - so we do recommend reserving your accommodation early.
                Cory and Ro will be staying in the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, which is a great option if you can find a rental or B&B, though unfortunately it doesn't have a lot of big hotels.
            </p>
            <p>We will provide one shuttle from Hilton Garden Inn and a second shuttle from the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake to the venue.

                        It is about a 20 minute drive to downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake.
                        We have a block of discounted rooms reserved there - use the code <code>LZW16</code> to get the group discount.

                        Both <a href="https://www.vrbo.com/">VRBO</a> and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">airbnb</a> have a number of vacation rentals in the area.
                        This is also a highly recommended and often more affordable option for those who don't mind something a bit more self-service.

            <h3>Things to Do</h3>
            <p>There's no shortage of things to do in Niagara! Some ideas are listed below.</p>
            <h4>Wine Tasting</h4>
            <p>
                If you have a designated driver, nothing beats a leisurely afternoon visiting a few of Niagara's beautiful vineyards and tasting the wine.
                If no one wants to drive, you can also <a href="http://zoomleisure.com/">rent a bike</a> or <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g154999-Activities-c42-t205-Niagara_on_the_Lake_Ontario.html">join a tour</a>.
                Follow the Niagara Wine Route.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trius has a fabulous high-end dining area.
                Inniskillin is renowned for their ice wine.
                For those of you who enjoy more full-bodied wines, Rowena is a fan of the Henry of Pelham Baco Noir Reserve.
                Southbrook is Canada’s first biodynamic winery and well known for excellent meals.
            </p>
            <h4>Niagara Falls</h4>
            <p>A walk around the falls at sunset or at night can be gorgeous. You can also take a ferry through them, though prepare to get wet!</p>
            <p>Around Niagara Falls is a thriving industry of haunted houses, a Butterfly Conservatory, Botanical Gardens, and even Niagara Falls Casino.</p>
            <h4>Golf</h4>
            <p>Plenty of scenic <a href="http://www.notlgolf.com/index.html">golf options</a> around town, many of them using the same grounds for vines as for courses.</p>
            <h4>Spa</h4>
            <p>Two of the nicest hotels in town host relaxing spas: Secret Garden Spa at Prince of Wales and 100 Fountain Spa at Pillar and Post.</p>
            <h4>Shopping</h4>
            <p>
                There is a long tradition of Americans flocking to Canada for discount shopping and Canadians flocking to America for the same.
                In addition to a variety of outlet malls on both sides of the border, Niagara-on-the-Lake town also features a very quaint downtown with lots of unique shops.
            </p>
            <h4>Theater</h4>
            <p>
                The Shaw theater festival will be taking place in NOTL this weekend, producing the works of Bernard Shaw and Shavian playwrights.
                Theaters are located in NOTL town.
            </p>
            <h4>Buffalo Wings</h4>
            <p>
                Probably not worth a dedicated trip, but Buffalo NY is the hometown of buffalo wings.
                So if you’re driving through anyways, might be a chance to pay homage.
            </p>
            <h4>Botanical Gardens</h4>
            <p>Some people like flowers. If you’re one of them, <a href="http://www.niagaraparks.com/niagara-falls-attractions/botanical-gardens.html">go here</a>. There’s even a butterfly conservatory.</p>
            <h4>Eat</h4>
            <p>
                Great meals can be found at <a href="http://www.thegarrisonhouse.ca/#!home/mainPage">Garrison House</a>, <a href="http://www.treadwellcuisine.com/">Treadwell</a>, and <a href="http://backhouse.xyz/">Backhouse</a>.
                <a href="http://www.twosistersvineyards.com/site/kitchen-76">Kitchen 72</a> inside the Two Sisters Vineyard serves delicious Italian food inside of an impressive estate.
            </p>
            <h4>Drink</h4>
            <p><a href="http://www.silversmithbrewing.com/">Silversmith Brewing</a> is an excellent local artisanal brewery offering offbeat new drinks.</p>
            <p>Some informal later-night options include The Olde Angel Inn, Sandtrap, and the Irish Harp.</p>
            <h4>Celebrate Canada Day!</h4>
            <p>
                On Friday night, July 1st, from the Southern banks of Lake Ontario on the north side of NOTL town, you will be able to see the fireworks light up across Toronto, Hamilton, and Niagara.
            </p>
            <h4>Celebrate America Day!</h4>
            <p>God knows what those Americans do. Have a BBQ?</p>

                People have referred to Cory and Rowena as "the greatest couple in the history of time".
                They have also called them "a power couple the likes of which the world has never before seen".
                Okay, the people that said those things are Cory and Ro and they may be a little biased.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite their self-proclaimed greatness, Cory and Ro have a pretty typical story. They met working together.
                Cory was blown away by Rowena's passion and thirst for adventure.
                Ro thought Cory was alright looking and a pretty good programmer.
                It did take years, but somehow he managed to woo her into considering him as a partner, and the rest has been history.

            <p>
                Cory bought a ring in India and, without a better plan, decided he would carry it around in his pocket until the right moment presented itself.
                That lasted about three days.
                The first weekend after Cory returned, we decided to go for a hike up Chapman’s Peak, a mountain south of Cape Town.
                The wind was intense, the trail was closed, and all the vegetation had just burnt down in a forest fire, but we climbed up anyways.
                At the top, with Hout Bay beach unfolding behind us, Constantia to the North, the Atlantic Ocean to our left and the Indian Ocean to our right,
                Cory popped the question and we agreed to spend the rest of our lives together.
                Good timing too, because minutes later the clouds rolled in and eclipsed everything.
